Okay here are my notes on the data structures that I have implemented in C++ and some
extra details and ideas that I got along with it!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not use bits/stdc++.h as during the time of coding test, these librarires might not be
available
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow! I wrote a brilliant code for linked list. Vey clean. Amazing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a doubly linked list, swap the prev and the next pointers and set the head to the last 
element and you are done!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shiv! If you wanna get somewhere, then you have to implement all those data structures 
that you think won't matter. Be hyper good  at what you do. Please!
