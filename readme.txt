Here are all my coding problems and the solution for them in python and C++
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ip.txt is the universal input redirection file that I will be using to redirect 
input to the code

out.txt is the universal output for the codes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
All the codes that I will write must start with a commented problem statement. 
Every code must have the name of the problem and the code extension.

Instruction for Github repository upload and commits:
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push -u origin master

Remeber to make flashcards after you have made written any code!

Types of Algorithm problems that I have explored:
- Greedy
- Dynamic
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- Branch and bound

the folder named DataStructures contains all the C++ implementations of basic data structures.
Look out for important notes and flashcard points in that folder
