Here are all the cpp notes that I have written and understood!

in CPP, sorting something a vector of pair by its second element, you can use the inbuilt function in c++

it goes like this:

---
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), sort_by_sec);
---

Driver fucntion fot it
---
bool sort_by_sec(cont std::pair &a, const std::pair &b){
	return a.second < b.second;
}
---

This method exploits the fact that, in any sorting method, comparisions are made. Ultimately, this code allows the inbuilt algorithm to compare directly the second element of the pair
